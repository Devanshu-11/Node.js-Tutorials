// 1- Node.js is not a programming Language, it is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine 
// 2- Browser like the chrome etc have in built engines which processes and renders the html, css and js to display web pages
// 3- In simple words a Nodejs is just like a container or like an environment in which our js code can be run outside the browser
// 4- If we use it outside the browser then we can access the data files of the system and can interact with the database like mongodb, mysql without needed of the browser api's
// 5- We will not prefer nodejs if we are doing the heavy server side processing like- image manipulation, video conversions and file compressions
// 6- Node.js is a single threaded based on event driven, non blocking I/O Model
